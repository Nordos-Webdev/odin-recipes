        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 ball Best Homemade Pizza Dough
            </li>
            <li>⅓ cup Easy Pizza Sauce
            </li>
            <li>3 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese (or about ¾ cup shredded mozzarella)
            </li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the dough using the Best Pizza Dough recipe (follow this video instruction for more). Follow the preparation instructions in the dough recipe if prepared in advance.
            </li>
            <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your pizza oven (here’s the pizza oven we have!).
            </li>
            <li>Make the Homemade Pizza Sauce.
            </li>
            <li>Slice the mozzarella into ¼ inch thick pieces. If it’s incredibly watery fresh mozzarella (all brands vary), you may want to let it sit on a paper towel to remove moisture for about 15 minutes then dab the mozzarella with the paper towel to remove any additional moisture.
            </li>
        </ol>
