        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>3 to 4 servings fresh jajangmyeon/udon noodles (about 6 ounces per serving)
            </li>
            <li>5 tablespoons Chunjang (춘장), Korean black bean paste some may be labeled as jjajang (짜장)
            </li>
            <li>8 to 10 ounces pork (preferably with some visible fat, pork shoulder cut, Boston butt, etc.) or lean cut if preferred
            </li>
            <li>1 extra large onion (or 2 medium, 12 to 14 ounces) See note if adding potatoes
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Have a pot of water ready to cook the noodles. Turn the heat on when you start cooking the meat. This way you will have the boiling water ready, for cooking the noodles, by the time the sauce is done.
            </li>
            <li>Prepare the pork and vegetables by cutting them into ½ - ¾ inch cubes. Marinate the pork with a tablespoon of rice wine (or mirin), ginger, salt and pepper while preparing the vegetables.
            </li>
            <li>Add the black bean paste to a small saucepan with the oil, sugar, and the optional oyster sauce. Fry it over medium heat for 2 - 3 minutes, stirring constantly.
            </li>
            <li>Heat a large pan with 2 tablespoons of cooking oil over medium high heat. Add the pork and ginger and stir fry until no longer pink, adding a tablespoon of soy sauce half way through. 
            </li>
        </ol>
